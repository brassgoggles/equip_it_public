# equip_it_public

This is the public version of the Equip It project - A program to rent equipment and manage staff.

If you want to run the project, you will have to add a Config class that contains a root path and an apiKey.

You will be unable to access any of the application data as seen on the Turtleshell Software server (https://equipit.turtleshellsoftware.com) for privacy reasons but please feel free to create your own API and database to use.

If you have any feedback on the project or want to get in touch, please feel free to email me at info@turtleshellsoftware.com

Enjoy the project and Flutter on!
